 ACL(自然语言处理方向顶级会议)
---------------------------
The conference covers a broad spectrum of disciplines working towards enabling intelligent systems to interact with humans using natural language, to understanding computational and other linguistic properties of language, and to enhancing human-human communication through services such as speech recognition, automatic translation, information retrieval, text summarization, and information extraction. The conference program includes presentation of accepted papers, as posters and/or oral presentation, and also includes tutorials, demonstrations, and workshops. The ACL 2014 program will also include eligible papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL), the new journal of the ACL. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas: 

Phonology and Morphology, Word Segmentation;
Syntax, Tagging, Chunking and Parsing;
Semantics;
Multimodal Natural Language Processing;
Discourse, Dialogue, and Pragmatics;
Linguistic aspects of CL;

 SIGIR（信息检索方面最好的会议）
----------------------------
SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The Conference and Program Chairs invite all those working in areas related to IR to submit original papers for review. SIGIR 2014 welcomes contributions related to any aspect of IR theory and foundation, techniques, and applications. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to: 

Document Representation and Content Analysis (e.g., text representation, document structure, linguistic analysis, NLP for IR, cross- and multi-lingual IR, information extraction, sentiment analysis, clustering, classification, topic models, facets, text streams);
Queries and Query Analysis (e.g., query intent, query suggestion and prediction, query representation and reformulation, query log analysis, conversational search and dialogue, spoken queries, summarization, question answering);
Retrieval Models and Ranking (e.g., IR theory, language models, probabilistic retrieval models, learning to rank, combining searches, diversity and aggregated search);
Search Engine Architectures and Scalability (e.g., indexing, compression, distributed IR, P2P IR, mobile IR, cloud IR);
Users and Interactive IR (e.g., user studies, user and task models, interaction analysis, session analysis, exploratory search, personalized search, social and collaborative search, search interface, whole session support);
Filtering and Recommending (e.g., content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, recommender systems);
Evaluation (e.g., test collections, experimental design, effectiveness measures, session-based evaluation, simulation);
Web IR and Social Media Search (e.g., link analysis, click models/behavioral modeling, social tagging, social network analysis, blog and microblog search, forum search, community-based QA, adversarial IR and spam, vertical and local search);
IR and Structured Data (e.g., XML search, ranking in databases, desktop search, entity search);
Multimedia IR (e.g., image search, video search, speech/audio search, music search);
Other Applications (e.g., digital libraries, enterprise search, genomics IR, legal IR, patent search, text reuse, new retrieval problems).

 ICDM
-----
The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) has established itself as the world's premier research conference in data mining. We invite high-quality papers reporting original research on all aspects of data mining, including applications, algorithms, software, and systems. We especially encourage submissions that promote the advancement of data mining as a scientific and engineering discipline and submissions that bridge different disciplines with data mining, such as statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, databases, data warehousing, visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high-performance computing. Papers are rigorously evaluated based on novelty, technical merit, significance, clarity, relevance, and repeatability. Papers submitted should be original work, not previously published or currently reviewed in a peer-reviewed conference or journal. 

备注：ICDM虽然从2001年开始举办，但名气上升很快，在数据挖掘方面俨然有追上SIGKDD的趋势。ICDM2014于2014年12月14日-2014年12月17日在中国深圳召开；提交日期：2014年6月24日；通知日期：2014年9月24日。
